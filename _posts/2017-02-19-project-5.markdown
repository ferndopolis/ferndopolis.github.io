description: Working with Art Design Office I contributed to these artist sites using django. <a target="_blank" href="//www.kimmccarty.net">Kim McCarty</a> my first django project. <a target="_blank" href="//www.josephkohnke.com/">Joseph Kohnke</a> worked out a relationship with the Collection model, so that artist collections could be related as many levels deep as specified within the cms. <a target="_blank" href="//www.lindastark.net">Linda Stark</a> and <a target="_blank" href="//www.karynlovegrove.com/">Karyn Lovegrove</a> sites incorporate minimal and responsive design, which I value most in app design. For ParentPro (no longer live) I worked on the authentication and User model using angular.
