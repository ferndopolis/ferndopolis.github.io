description: My first dev job, started with team of three taking existing buggy code base and prepare it for launch. My tasks included writing unit and end-to-end test, fixing the authentication process, payment system, and redesign of site.  Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of app when we worked on it but app is still in production.
